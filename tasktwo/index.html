            <h3 class="subTitleDiv"> Brief </h3>
            <p>One of the most important revolutionaries in the Indian Nationalist Movement is Bhagat Singh. On September 28, 1907, Kishan Singh and Vidyavati gave birth to Bhagat Singh in Banga, Lyallpur District (now Pakistan). When he was born, his uncles Ajit and Swaran Singh, as well as his father Kishan Singh, were all imprisoned for protesting the 1906 Colonization Bill. Being raised in a politically conscious household where his family supported the Ghadar party, young Bhagat Singh developed a sense of patriotism.</p>
            
            <p> Bhagat Singh started supporting Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement at a very young age. Bhagat Singh openly resisted the British and carried out Gandhi's request by setting fire to publications that were sponsored by the government. In fact, he quit school altogether to enrol in Lahore's National College. The 1919 Jallianwala Bagh Massacre and the 1921 murder of unarmed Akali demonstrators at the Nankana Sahib both occurred when he was a teenager, and both events strongly influenced his patriotic viewpoint.</p>
            <p>The Naujawan Bharat Sabha was established in March 1925, with Bhagat Singh serving as its secretary, and was motivated by nationalist movements in Europe. In addition, Bhagat Singh joined the radical Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which he eventually renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) with fellow revolutionaries Chandrashekhar Azad and Sukhdev.

            <h3 class = "subTitleDiv"> Early life</h3>
            
            <p> Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914-1915.
            </p>
            
            <p> After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore. In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.
            </p>
            <p>Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest.  He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British.

            <h3 class="subTitleDiv"> Legacy</h3>
            <p>Bhagat Singh was the perfect role model for the youth of his period because of his passionate patriotism and developed idealism. He became the voice of his generation through his criticism of the British Imperial Government in writing and speech. Numerous people have questioned his dramatic departure from Gandhi's non-violent path to Swaraj, yet with his daring embrace of martyrdom, he encouraged hundreds of teenagers and young adults to fully engage in the freedom movement. Bhagat Singh won the title of Greatest Indian in a 2008 India Today poll, beating out Subhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi, demonstrating his standing in modern society.
